# Universal Welfare Protocol (UWP)

## Introduction

The Universal Welfare Protocol (UWP) is a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution designed to revolutionize how government benefits are distributed and accessed by citizens. Inspired by systems like UPI, UWP brings efficiency, transparency, and security to welfare schemes, ensuring quick and effective delivery of benefits directly to eligible individuals.

## Problem being solved

I heard somewhere, India is divided into 3 parts: the ones who consume, the ones who make the lives of the ones who consume easier and lastly the labourers. Other than the 1% who just consume, the other 2 sects which make up the 105 crore, 50% of them have access to the internet, to use the internet for the welfare of the masses is crucial.
We want UWP to be used by these masses to use this card in their daily life efficiently. Right now, we are having conversations about a pilot with the State Government.
